### A Hitman 3 Mod about Lucas Grey

## Mod description:

This mod is a new campaign that follows Lucas Grey throughout his journey in the World of Assassination Trilogy, beginning with his and 47's assault on The Institute for Human Betterment, through the assault on Providence, and on the Partners. It is broken up into multiple missions, each based on a situation described or shown in the original trilogy. Each mission will be played in one of the destinations in the original trilogy, but occasionally the location will be repurposed to take place in a different setting’s location.

# Planned Campaign Mission and Cutscene list:

## Cutscene: Prologue

The cutscene from the original trilogy, where Subject 6 and Subject 47 are angry after being returned to the Institute after running away and having their would-be rescuers killed, plays, but with Lucas Grey doing a voiceover describing the events in a new way. They begin planning their revenge on Providence, and cut their hands and mark the wall with their handprints in blood. The cutscene then jumps ahead in time to the present, where Subject 6 and Subject 47 fight their way into the Institute and are pinned down. 47 is injured and tells Subject 6 to escape, blowing a hole in the wall through which Subject 6 jumps.

**Sandbox Destination**: Safehouse  
**Briefing Cutscene**: Lucas Grey has landed in front of Rubble falls in front of the hole in the wall.

Subject 6 must escape to the exit at the entrance of the safehouse level. All the areas of safehouse besides the path from the front entrance to the exit are blocked off, and all the doors are non-interactable. The only NPCs are mercenaries, armed with automatic rifles, and they are all enforcers for the Tactical Wetsuit disguise. After the level begins, a grenade is detonated inside the mansion, which will alert the guards.
